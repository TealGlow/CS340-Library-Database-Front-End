Right now bugs that need to be fixed:
- Update works on books table, but it does not redirect page after an update.
- need to change on shelf, right now it shows checked no matter what, doesnt update correctly.
- make it so that place holder on publication date actually works

Need to do:
- finish connecting select and insert to all other tables.
- fix update, and connect it to all other tables.
- handle the deletion of a row for all tables.
- remove the value = "" on all other forms, it messes with the update function
