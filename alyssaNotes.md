Not done in this branch:
- select, insert, and modify for tables: Sections, Authors
- Delete for: CheckedOutBooks and BookAuthors
  - I think that the delete for CheckedOutBooks and BookAuthors might be a little weird, but I'm not sure yet.


Things to change:
- Maybe removal of the option to change Primary keys for tables? Right now it works, but it just feels weird to have that as an option.
